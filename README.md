### I build [Baby Names Shiny App](http://www.domaghale.com/intro-to-data-science/shiny-app/) as a part of the Data Science class I took in Spring 2018. 

The R code used to produce the App is found in [Baby Names Shiny App R Code](https://github.com/d-ghale/Shiny_App/blob/master/Baby_Name_Ghale.R)
